# Development of a blogging website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite and Node.js 

## Description of extent to which our team has completed the compulsory features
When a user browses to the blog, they have the option of browsing the blog as a guest or logging in. If the user chooses to continue as a guest, the user is redirected to the article page where they can browse available articles. If the user chooses to log in, the user is redirected to the login page. If they do not have an account, they can create an account. 

When creating a new account, the user needs to fill in a form with their details (username, password, real name, date of birth and a description of themselves). The username needs to be unique and the page will immediately inform the user if the username is taken or is available. When selecting the password, the user needs to enter it twice and it will inform the user immediately if the password does not match. The password is stored as a hash.

Once an account is created, the user can log in and out. They can additionally create a new article. Furthermore, they will be able to edit their account information.

The blog is desiged to be responsive to different screen sizes. 

## Extra features of the blog
Users are able to upvote or downvote articles. 

## Naming the database 
The database was named project-database.db and the sqlite file was named project-database.sql.

## Running the app
